# ts-prep

_ðŸ§© A TypeScript starter for solving LeetCode problems with test-driven-development_

# Usage

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Prerequisites</strong>
  </summary>

  - Ensure you have 
  [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  installed on your machine before proceeding.

  - Clone this repo locally and `cd` into it
</details>

1. Install dependencies
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
 
 2. Start test-driven-development (TDD)
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
    _This script runs [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode._

3. Start making changes! 
   - You will see your changes be validated against your test cases.
   - [Add a new problem](#add-a-new-problem) with the script (or manually)


## Add a new problem

You can add a new problem manually by following the repo [structure](#structure). 
However, this repo comes with a script to quickly set up starter files for new LeetCode problems&mdash;letting you focus on the real problem solving!

In the root directory of the repo, run
```shell
npm run new-problem '<title>'
```
<details>
 <summary>
  Where <code><title></code> is the LeetCode problem's title.
  </summary>

- The format of the title should be: `{number}. {name}` 
- The title must start with a number, followed by a period. Otherwise, the script won't work!
- The title should be wrapped in quotes for the argument to get passed into the script
</details>

For example, if you want to set up starter files for problem _[202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)_, you would run
```shell
npm run new-problem '202. Happy Number'
```

<details>
 <summary>
  About this script
 </summary>
 
This script is defined in the `package.json`. 
It uses your local Node runtime environment to execute the `scripts/new-problem.js` file.
The script parses the inputted title and uses the templates to auto-generate the boilerplate `.md` and `.ts` files.

You could run this script directly from the repo root:
```shell
node ./scripts/new-problem.js -t '<title>'
```
</details>


## Structure

**`src/` directory** &ndash; In general, you should do all your work here
- Each LeetCode problem should have its own directory
- Add a `.md` file in the problem directory for the problem description and discussion
- Add a `.ts` file in the problem directory to solve and test

**`scripts/` directory** &ndash; Contains custom scripts
- The `new-problem.js` script is used to set up starter files for new LeetCode problems
- The `templates` directory contains files that define the boilerplate content for auto-generating `.md` and `.ts` files
- Feel free to add or modify scripts or templates to fit your needs

**`jest.config.js` file** &ndash; Defines our custom Jest configuration
- We match test cases defined in regular `.ts` files
  - By default, Jest matches `.ts` files in a `__tests__` dir or if the filename ends with `.spec.ts` or `.test.ts`
  - Our custom `testMatch` rule lets write code to solve and test in one file
- We use `ts-jest` as a dependency to transform `.ts` files for Jest
  - By default, Jest only works with JavaScript
